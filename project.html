            •Minimize blackouts during peak hours and enhance grid reliability.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Disaster Management:</h3>
          <p>
            •Quickly prioritize power supply to critical infrastructure during natural disasters or emergencies.
            •Dynamically reroute electricity from less critical zones to high-need areas.
          </p>
          <h3> 3. Renewable Energy Management:</h3>
          <p>
            •Efficiently allocate intermittent renewable energy from solar farms or wind turbines.
            •Reduce reliance on fossil fuels by using renewables and storage intelligently.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Industrial Energy Optimization:</h3>
          <p>
            •Analyze energy requirements for manufacturing plants and allocate power to maximize production efficiency.
            •Reduce downtime due to electricity unavailability            
          </p>
          <h3>5. Rural Electrification:</h3>
          <p>
            •Efficiently manage limited electricity supply in remote areas.
            •Balance power between agricultural needs (e.g., irrigation) and residential use.            
          </p>
          <h3>6. Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Networks:</h3>
          <p>     
            •Distribute electricity to EV charging stations based on demand forecasts.

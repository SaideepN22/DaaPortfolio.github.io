        <h2 class="title">Identified Business Ideas and Challenges:</h2>
        <h3>Business Ideas:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Listing all the areas by distance</li>
          <li>Renewable energy integration</li>
          <li>Energy Efficiency Management</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Challenges:</h3>
        <h4>1. Challenges in Learning/Understanding the Above Concepts:</h4>
        <p>Learning concepts like time complexity analysis, binary search trees, and graph algorithms often involves understanding abstract mathematical principles and their practical applications. Visualization and intuition can be challenging for topics like DFS, BFS, and heaps, which require a strong grasp of recursion and data structures.</p>

        <h4>2. Challenges in Correlating with Real-World Applications:</h4>
        <p>Relating these concepts to real-world problems requires bridging the gap between theory and practice. For example, understanding how graph algorithms are applied in social network analysis or how pattern searching works in DNA sequencing can be abstract without hands-on projects or case studies.</p>

        <h4>3. Determining the Most Efficient Approach/Design Techniques for Solving a Complex Problem:</h4>
        <p>Choosing the best approach involves evaluating trade-offs in time and space complexity, considering the problem's constraints, and often experimenting with different algorithms. This requires analytical skills, a solid understanding of the problem domain, and sometimes iterative refinement to optimize performance.</p>
